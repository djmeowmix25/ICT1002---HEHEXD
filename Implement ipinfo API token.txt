This application uses the ipinfo free service to pull geolocation information. 
By default, the ipinfo API has a rate limit of 1,000 requests a day. We can create an account with the service provider and use an access token that will allow the user to increase the rate limit to 50,000 requests a month with a free account, or more with a paid account. 

In order to implement the token, the user is required to modify the Geocoder library. 
Find out where the library is installed on your computer (using 'pip install geocoder' in CMD will say so), the file path might look something like this:

C:\Users\dejun\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages\geocoder

Open the 'ipinfo.py' file, and replace the "_before_initialize" function with the one shown below:

def _before_initialize(self, location, **kwargs):
        token = kwargs.get('token') or ''
        if location.lower() == 'me' or location == '':
            self.url = 'http://ipinfo.io/json?token={0}'.format(token)
        else:
            self.url = 'http://ipinfo.io/{0}/json?token={1}'.format(self.location, token)


The access token, generated from ipinfo's website with an account can then be added in "ip_process.py". 
For this submission, the token has already been added, but the geocoder library needs to be modified for the token to be used.
